#  SCHOOL PROJECT

## Description
This is a school project I worked on that involved building several early-stage AI programs. The program is written in Python, and I used Pandas to clean the data, I used Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize some of the file and then used AI to predict certain outcomes. One of my favorites in Unit 1 predicts the survival of passengers on the titanic based on factors like class and gender.

## Technologies Used:
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Numpy, Sklearn, Jupyter Notebook
